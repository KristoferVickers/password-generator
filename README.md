# password-generator

This was the best project in my opionon so far had me scartching my head a few times but was a fun one to dissect. 
I started off with uploading my files to my git hub repo then adding the starter code that was given to the empty files. 

Once I had it looking like the example I mainly just used java script input examples from w3 schools and from our last weeks notes. I got stuck at the end when it was telling me it couldn't load my js file to the html so I had to fork that input that was given and change the source to the correct path. 

The function of this app will let you pick a number that ranges from 8 to 128 characters long. It will inculde upper case, lower case, special characters, and numbers. 

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_input_examples.asp   -W3 schools input examples.

How the app will function:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is written to the page.
